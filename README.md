## üéØ  Objective of this project
- Backround
FLashcards are apopular way of studying and testing your knowledge. That is why this app will prompt the users to answer all the history questions to test their history knowledge.

- Objective 
I was tasked with to develope a native Android app using kotlin. This will help the users study with flashcards.This app will have presentable `features`, `looped through flashcards`and `provide a score with comments depending on your score`.

- Report

## üìù How to change the questions of the flashcards using android studio
If you haven't already downloaded the repository here is guide on `how to install/clone a github Repo`:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSwRqOZo2Y8

Now that you have cloned the app you can open it on a tab in android studio and navigate to main_Activity2:

You can input your new questions and answers here.

## üõ†Ô∏è The problems that you might encounter and difficulties I fixed
- The only problem I found so far since uploading this app to my repository is when you press the `exit button` it opens the app again, although maybe it was a `glitch in emulator.`
- But the difficulties I faced was with the `If` statements working properly with the `updateQuestion()`:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21456fa7-693a-4ced-af5f-23b69949b7d7)
But I finally manageded to understand the concept of `updateQuestion()` function which automatically update the code for you during the run time of the project.
